Sprint based on employee attrition using both descripted and predicted analysis 
<h1>Attrition Analysis Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This project focuses on analyzing and addressing attrition within a company using a dataset. The main objectives were to clean the data, visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) using Power BI, propose solutions to reduce attrition rates, and choose the best model for predicting attrition.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset used for this analysis contains information related to employee attrition, including demographics, job-related factors, and tenure.</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>

<p>Before analysis, the dataset underwent thorough cleaning to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step ensured the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses.</p>

<h2>Visualizations</h2>

<p>Visualizations were created using Power BI to explore various KPIs related to attrition, such as departmental trends, attrition rates across different age groups and tenure lengths, and factors influencing attrition over time.</p>

<h2>Solutions for Attrition Reduction</h2>

<p>Based on the analysis, several solutions were proposed to reduce the attrition rate from its initial 16% to as close to 10% as possible. These solutions may include but are not limited to improvements in employee engagement, career development programs, and addressing specific pain points identified in the analysis.</p>

<h2>Model Selection</h2>

<p>Three machine learning models—logistic regression, linear regression, and k-nearest neighbors—were evaluated for their effectiveness in predicting attrition. Logistic regression was chosen as the preferred model due to its high accuracy score of 85%, minimal overfitting, and suitability as a starting benchmark for further analysis.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to attrition within the company and offers actionable recommendations for reducing attrition rates. The chosen model, logistic regression, serves as a reliable tool for predicting and addressing attrition, paving the way for future improvements in employee retention strategies.</p>
